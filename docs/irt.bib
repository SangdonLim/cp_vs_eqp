	abstract = {Lord and Wingersky’s (Appl Psychol Meas 8:453–461, 1984) recursive algorithm for creating summed score based likelihoods and posteriors has a proven track record in unidimensional item response theory (IRT) applications. Extending the recursive algorithm to handle multidimensionality is relatively simple, especially with ﬁxed quadrature because the recursions can be deﬁned on a grid formed by direct products of quadrature points. However, the increase in computational burden remains exponential in the number of dimensions, making the implementation of the recursive algorithm cumbersome for truly high-dimensional models. In this paper, a dimension reduction method that is speciﬁc to the Lord–Wingersky recursions is developed. This method can take advantage of the restrictions implied by hierarchical item factor models, e.g., the bifactor model, the testlet model, or the two-tier model, such that a version of the Lord–Wingersky recursive algorithm can operate on a dramatically reduced set of quadrature points. For instance, in a bifactor model, the dimension of integration is always equal to 2, regardless of the number of factors. The new algorithm not only provides an effective mechanism to produce summed score to IRT scaled score translation tables properly adjusted for residual dependence, but leads to new applications in test scoring, linking, and model ﬁt checking as well. Simulated and empirical examples are used to illustrate the new applications.},

	abstract = {Two methods to make inferences about scores that would have been obtained on one test using responses obtained with a different test are scale aligning and projection. If both tests measure the same construct, scale aligning may be accomplished using the results of simultaneous calibration of the items from both tests with a unidimensional IRT model. If the tests measure distinct but related constructs, an alternative is the use of regression to predict scores on one test from scores on the other; when the score distribution is predicted, this is projection. Calibrated projection combines those two methods, using a multidimensional IRT (MIRT) model to simultaneously calibrate the items comprising two tests onto scales representing distinct constructs, and estimating the parameters describing the relation between the two scales. Then projection is done within the MIRT model. This presentation describes two extensions of calibrated projection: (1) the use of linear models to compute the projected scores and their error variances, and (2) projection from more than one test to a single test. The procedures are illustrated using data obtained with scales measuring closely related quality of life constructs.},
