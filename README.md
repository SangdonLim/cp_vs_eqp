# CP vs EQP

This is a class project I did for EDP 380D Applied Psychometrics in Spring 2020.

In psychometrics, a crosswalk table is a table that maps each possible score level in one instrument to corresponding scores in another instrument. Scores can be raw sum scores, T-scores, or theta scores.

The goal of my project was to compare the crosswalk tables produced by 1) calibrated projection and 2) equipercentile equating.

The calibrated projection module used in this project was later implemented into an R package:
> PROsetta 0.2.0 - [CRAN link](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PROsetta)

The simulation design in this project also made its way into a publication:

> Schalet, B. D., Lim, S., Cella, D., Choi, S. W. (in press). Linking scores with patient-reported health outcome instruments: A validation study and comparison of three linking methods. *Psychometrika*.
